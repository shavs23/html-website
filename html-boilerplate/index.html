    <h1> My First Website</h1>
    

    <p><em>Lorem ipsum</em>, or <i>lipsum</i> as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. <br>
    The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's <strong> De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum </strong> <br>
    for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with: <br>

    <b>“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”</b> <br>

</p>

<p> The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout.<br>
    A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.<br></p>
